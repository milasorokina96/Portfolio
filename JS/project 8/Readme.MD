This project was created by me and my team. 
In this project, I developed the Cart tab and the modal Cart window (icon) that appears when you add a product to cart or click on the icon.
In the Cart tab and in the modal window, you can increase and decrease the number of goods, delete goods, move on to purchasing goods or fill out the order form and send it.
All possible options for user behavior on these pages were examined and bugs were prevented.
All information on added products and completed orders is stored in the local storage.
